# Graduate-Admission-Prediction

Project Name: Graduate Admission Prediction

Description:
This project aims to develop a predictive model for graduate admission based on various factors such as GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, statement of purpose (SOP), letter of recommendation (LOR), undergraduate GPA (CGPA), and research experience. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the chances of admission for prospective graduate students.

Key Features:
- Data Exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and visualize the distributions of different variables.
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale/normalize numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.
- Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing features to capture additional information that may improve the predictive performance.
- Machine Learning Modeling: Train and evaluate different machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, or random forests to predict the chance of admission.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like grid search or randomized search to find the optimal hyperparameters for the chosen model.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained models using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared.
- Deployment: Deploy the final model and create a user-friendly interface where users can input their profile details to get an estimate of their chances of admission.

Dataset:
The project utilizes a dataset containing information about past graduate applicants. The dataset includes features such as GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, research experience, and the target variable - the chance of admission. The dataset is available in a CSV format and will be included in the project repository.

Technologies and Libraries:
- Python: The project is implemented using Python programming language.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- NumPy: Used for numerical operations on the data.
- Scikit-learn: Used for machine learning modeling, including linear regression and hyperparameter tuning.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for data visualization and creating plots.
- Flask (Optional): If deployed, Flask can be used to create a web application for the admission prediction model.

This project serves as a practical application of machine learning techniques to predict graduate admission chances. It provides an opportunity to explore various steps in the data science pipeline, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model building and evaluation. The code and documentation in this repository can be a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding and implementing predictive modeling for graduate admission.
